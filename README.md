# Movies-you-will-love

An app to help you learn more about movies. Specifically including its rating, tagline, bio, year of release, director, actors, and where you can stream it. We were able to include this information through the use of the IMDB API and the Utelly API. 

As a team, our main struggles were with learning how to work collaboratively with other people and utilize many of the concepts we had been learning for the past few months all in one application.

You just simply go in and search any movie you would like the information for and it will take you to another page where you will get to see all of its information, as well as a movie poster. If you would like to search for a different movie, use the second search bar located on the left side of that page.
